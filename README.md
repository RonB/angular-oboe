A service to stream JSON data in to your controller.

This repo is for distribution on `bower`.

Many thanks to Jim Higson for the oboe.js library.
See http://oboejs.com

## What it does
The Oboe service collects a datastream and tries to parse the data as JSON objects.
You can pass a URL and a pattern to the service, which will return a promise. By processing the notification immediately in your scope, the user will experience your application as very fast, especially on mobile.

The module takes advantage of the defer and promise implementation of Angular and the Oboe.js library.
The Oboe library parses the JSON stream and recognizes the nodes which meets the criteria in the supplied pattern.
The module then collects the JSON objects and notifies the promise of the new node.

## Install

### To try the example:

Make sure you have the following installed:

* node with npm (for building the example and running the local server)
* bower (for dependency management)
* grunt (for running the node tasks)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/RonB/angular-oboe.git
cd angular-oboe
npm install
bower install
grunt
```
Now go to a browser and visit http://localhost:9000 


### Add module to your project using `bower`

Go to your project folder and run

```shell
bower install angular-oboe --save
```

Add a `<script>` to your `index.html`:

```html
<script src="/bower_components/oboe/dist/oboe-browser.min.js"></script>
<script src="/bower_components/angular-oboe/dist/angular-oboe.min.js"></script>
```

And add `ngOboe` module to your app:

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ngOboe']);
```

## Usage
In your controller you add data to your scope by calling the Oboe service. This returns a promise.
The service is called with an object that contains the parameters for the Oboe service.
They  are the same as the oboe.js API [http://oboejs.com/api].

### url:string
specify the url from which the json data should be read

### pattern:string
The pattern is to select JSON objects that meet that pattern.
http://oboejs.com/api#pattern-matching

### start:function
Callback function which is called when the stream starts with a handle to the stream as a parameter.
The stream has several functions and events. 
i.e: If you want to abort the stream while loading you can call the abort() method (http://oboejs.com/api#-abort-).

### done:function
Callback function which is called when the stream ends or,
if your datastream is not closed but streams multiple JSON objects, then this function is called every time a JSON object is parsed, with the parsed JSON as a parameter.

## Returned promise
To use the data in your controller you call the 'then' function of the returned promise.

You can pass three functions:

1. The first function is called after the Oboe stream finishes. In some cases however, if the stream has multiple JSON objects, you use the 'done' callback. The promise will only be resolved once.
2. The second function is called when an error occurs,
3. The third function is called when a JSON object meeting the pattern is received. Use this function to add the received object to your scope.

```javascript
angular.module('MyApp')
    .controller(['$scope', 'Oboe', function($scope, Oboe) {
        $scope.myData = [];
        Oboe({
            url: '/api/myData',
            pattern: '{index}',
            start: function(stream) {
                // handle to the stream
                $scope.stream = stream;
                $scope.status = 'started';
            },
            done: function(parsedJSON) {
                $scope.status = 'done';
            }
        }).then(function() {
            // promise is resolved
        }, function(error) {
            // handle errors
        }, function(node) {
            // node received
            $scope.myData.push(node);
            if($scope.myData.length === 1000) {
                $scope.stream.abort();
                alert('The maximum of one thousand records reached');
            }
        });
    }]);
```

The entire parameter object will be passed to the Oboe funtion [http://oboejs.com/api].
Use this to accomplish authentication with the backend:

```javascript
angular.module('MyApp')
    .controller(['$scope', 'Oboe', function($scope, Oboe) {
        $scope.myData = [];
        Oboe({
            url: '/api/myData',
            pattern: '{index}',
            withCredentials: true,
            headers: {
                Authentication: 'Basic '  + btoa('yourusername:yourpassword')
            }
        }).then(function() {
            // promise is resolved
        }, function(error) {
            // handle errors
        }, function(node) {
            // node received
            $scope.myData.push(node);
        });
    }]);
```

## Caveats

Parsing the entire datastream might take longer if the JSON is served in one chunk because parsing the
data in JS is slower than the standard native parsing in the browser. It might use more CPU than desired in that case.
